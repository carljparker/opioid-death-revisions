I'm writing to ask about some recent changes in the data presented on the King County Fatal Overdose Dashboard.

I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington studying data science, and I have been following the data on the King County Fatal Overdose Dashboard at the following URL:

https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/examiner/services/reports-data/overdose.aspx

Recently, I noticed that the numbers for drug & alcohol poisoning deaths have been revised down for all years from 2008-2020. In fact, the numbers for 2020 were revised down twice. 

Can you provide some context as to what motivated the revisions to these numbers?

Below I've listed, for each year, the original numbers and the revised-down numbers.

2008:  272 -> 266
2009:  265 -> 260
2010:  260 -> 248
2011:  247 -> 245
2012:  278 -> 272
2013:  315 -> 312
2014:  326 -> 319
2015:  329 -> 322
2016:  344 -> 336
2017:  381 -> 368
2018:  417 -> 403
2019:  434 -> 422
2020:  540 -> 513 -> 511
